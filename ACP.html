    <h1>Snakes of Bangalore</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A short list showcasing some of the diverse snake species seen in the Bangalore Urban District. <br>
        These species are displayed by <b><i>family-level</i></b> taxonomy. <br>
        Though only 8 species are showcased here, a <b><i><a
                    href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358564784_Annotated_checklist_of_the_snakes_of_Bengaluru_Urban_District_Karnataka_India_with_notes_on_their_natural_history_distribution_and_population_trends_over_the_last_150_years" >recent
                    study</a></i></b> from 2021 shows that a total of 33 species are found
        within the district. Of which, only 4 are medically significant (life threatening) to humans. <br><br>

        <!-- VIPERS -->
    <h2>Vipers <i>(Viperidae)</i></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>All Vipers are venomous and are generally characterised by their keeled scales, triangular shaped heads, and
        slit-shaped pupils. Vipers typically have a stocky build, suiting them as nocturnal ambush predators. Unlike
        most snakes, most vipers are <i>ovoviviparous</i>, meaning they give live birth as opposed to laying eggs.</p>

    <!-- RUSSELLS VIPER  -->
    <h4>Russell's Viper <i>(Daboia russelii)</i> - Venomous</h4>
    <p><i>Russell's Vipers</i> are part of the <i>"Big 4"</i> species of venomous snakes found in India and are
        responsible for the
        most amount of snakebite deaths in Asia. These snakes thrive in agricultural areas and most bites happen when
        people walk around outside without a light and acidentally step on the snake. <br>
        Although they seem menacing, these snakes don't want to hurt humans and will let out a loud warning hiss that
        sounds like a pressure-cooker.</p>

    <!-- SAW SCALED VIPER -->
    <h4>Saw-scaled Viper <i>(Echis carinatus)</i> - Venomous</h4>
    <p><i>Saw-scaled Vipers</i> are part of the <i>"Big 4"</i> and get their name from the sawing sound their keeled
        scales make when
        rubbing together in an S-shaped motion. They make this sound as a warning. These snakes are generally quite
        small in size (15 - 30 inches)
        but have one of the fastest strikes. </p>

        <li>Reddish-brown coloured body with <i>zig-zag pattern</i> and a <i>'+' shaped pattern on the head.</i></li>

    </ul>
    <b>Sometimes confused with:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Common Cat Snake</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br><br>
  

    <!-- ELAPIDS -->
    <h2>Elapids <i>(Elapidae)</i></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Practically all Elapids are venomous, characterised by typically having smooth scales, slender bodies, and round
        pupils. All elapids have front fangs that are fixed in place and inject primarily neurotoxic venom. Most are
        <i>oviparous</i>, meaning they lay eggs rather than giving birth.
    </p>

    <h4>Spectacled Cobra <i>(Naja naja)</i> - Venomous</h4>
    <p><i>Spectacled Cobras</i> are part of the <i>"Big 4"</i>, famous for the spectacle pattern on the back of its
        hood. These cobras
        also have two dots on the front side of the hood that serve as fake eyes to distract predators. <br>
        Cobras can raise up to 1/3 of their body and "hood up" by flattening their neck ribs, stretching the skin out as
        a threatening display. <br>
        Though they have a potent neurotoxic venom (drop-for-drop more potent than the <i>King Cobra</i>), they hold a
        powerful
        religious significance in Hinduism and are often left alone. Other venomous snakes like the <i>Russell's
            Viper</i>,
        however, lack this significance and are often unfairly killed on sight. </p>

            <li>South India: <i>Yellowish-brown</i> colour with <i>prominent </i>hood pattern.</li>
            <li>North India: <i>Much darker</i> colouration with hood patterns <i>possibly absent</i>.</li>
            <li>Slender body with <i>smooth scales</i>. Grows up to 3 - 5 feet on average</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Sometimes confused with:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Indian Rat Snake</li>
        </ul>
        <br> <br>


    <h4>Common Krait <i>(Bungarus caeruleus)</i> - Venomous</h4>
    <p>The final member of the <i>"Big 4"</i>, the <i>Common Krait</i>, has the most potent venom out of four. <br>
        This snake is nocturnal and identified by its slender body and white double-banded stripes that run along the
        body. This pattern typically starts about 1/3 of the way down the body. <br>
        Like the <i>Russell's Viper</i>, most bites happen at night when they are accidentally stepped on in rural /
        agricultural areas. <br>
        Unlike the rest of the <i>Big 4</i>, kraits don't have any audible or visual defense mechanism or warning. </p>

    <!-- COLUBRIDS -->
    <h2>Colubrids <i>(Colubridae)</i></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The Colubrid family is the largest snake family in the world with members of this family being found on every
        continent except Antarctica. A majority of these snakes are harmless with only a few medically significant
        exceptions. Most are <i>oviparous</i>.</p>
    <h4>Indian Rat Snake <i>(Pytas mucosa)</i> - Harmless</h4>
    <p><i>Indian Rat Snakes</i> are a diurnal species and among the most commonly seen snakes throughout India. These
        snakes
        are often mistaken to be cobras by the untrained eye but are much larger in length, averaging sizes of around 6
        - 8 feet, making them among the largest nonvenomous species found in India.<br>
        Having rat snakes around your area is actually a benefit because not only are they excellent and natural rat
        control, but they'll actually scare off smaller venomous snakes from the area, making it a safer environment.

    <h4>Indian Wolf Snake <i>(Lycodon aulicus)</i> - Harmless</h4>
    <p>The <i>Indian Wolf Snake</i> gets its name from a couple of fang-like front teeth that resemble the canines of a
        wolf.
        The wolf snake is often confused with the <i>Common Krait</i> as the appearance is similar with some key
        differences:
        the wolf snake's pattern always starts from the back of the neck, in contrast with the krait's, and has a more
        brown colour as opposed to the krait's solid black. <br>
        Wolf snakes are comfortable climbers and can be found looking for geckos between the bricks of houses or natural
        rocks and granite hills in the wild. </p>

    <h4>Bronzeback Tree Snake <i>(Dendrelaphis bifrenalis)</i> - Harmless</h4>
    <p><i>Bronzeback Tree Snakes</i> are diurnal and arboreal hunters, mainly targeting frogs and lizards. At night,
        they can
        be seen sleeping in the peripheral of trees, their colouration providing good camoflauge. </p>

    <!-- PYTHONS -->
    <h2>Pythons <i>(Pythonidae)</i></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Pythons are large, snakes with a muscular build that constrict their prey by coiling around and suffocating them.
        All python species are nonvenomous and <i>oviparous</i>. <br>
        There are three species of python found in India. </p>

    <h4>Indian Rock Python <i>(Python molurus)</i> - Harmless</h4>
    <p><i>Indian Rock Pythons</i> are a rare find in the outskirts of the city and are the only species of python found
        outside
        of the North Eastern states or the Andaman Islands. They are ambush hunters with an expansive diet, consisting
        primarily of locally abundant mammals. <br>
        Average adults are 10 - 16 feet in length. </p>
